# Water-pipe Routing in the Brazilian Semi-arid Region

    This repository is based on a study, proposed as a challenge by the National Center for Monitoring and Early Warning of Natural Disasters (CEMADEN) for the Mathematical Modeling Problem Solving course at UNIFESP, aims to optimize the routing of water trucks for water distribution in the Brazilian semiarid region, with a focus on the state of Rio Grande do Norte. Water truck distribution is one of the initiatives undertaken to mitigate the impacts of drought. In this context, considering the location of water sources, the army regulates and monitors the distribution to active beneficiaries, who are individuals or groups served by the program. The main objective is to minimize the total operation cost and create routes for supplying water from the sources to the beneficiaries. The data analysis employed both Linear Programming and Heuristic methods. As a result, a 26\% reduction in the total operation cost was achieved, along with a new route for water supply to the beneficiaries.

  On this repository, you will find the code material used to perform the calculations. Files and data locations where removed.
